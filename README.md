# 20 12 02 JS Loops Practice

Complete exercises 1 - 4 in order. Add comments above each exercise solution (at minium). HTML and JS files have already been included in the assignment. Comment out any broken code before 9PM submission and provide context on what's not working.

### Exercise 1 : Counting 
Using a for loop, iterate from 1 to 10 increasing by 1 each iteration. Output the current value of the iterator in the console on each iteration.

### Exercise 2 : Counting Backward
Using a for loop, iterate from 10 to 1 decreasing by 1 each iteration. Output the current value of the iterator in the console on each iteration.

### Exercise 3 : Iterate Through an Array
Declare an array `supplyArray` with the following string elements : loose leaf paper, black markers, scissors, tape, tape dispenser. Using a for loop, iterate through the `supplyArray`. Output each array element using the current value of the iterator in the console on each iteration in the formatted message : "Supply : [ELEMENT]"

### Exercise 4 : Iterate Through an Array + Conditionals 
Using a for loop, iterate through the `supplyArray`. Output each array element using the current value of the iterator in the console on each iteration in the formatted message : "In Stock : [ELEMENT]", unless the element is black markers. In which case output the formatted message : "Out of Stock [ELEMENT]"
